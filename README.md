# Abusive-Comment-Identification-in-Malayalam-Language

YouTube is a video-sharing and social media platform where users create profiles and share videos for 
their followers to view, like, and comment on. Abusive comments on videos or replies to other 
comments may be offensive and detrimental for the mental health of users on the platform. It is 
observed that often the language used in these comments is informal and does not necessarily adhere 
to the formal syntactic and lexical structure of the language. With the increasing presence of abusive 
language and toxicity in online platforms, particularly YouTube, the need for efficient and accurate 
identification of such content in regional languages like Malayalam has become imperative. Therefore, 
creating a rule-based system for filtering out abusive comments is challenging.

This project aims to utilize natural language processing and deep learning approaches for identifying 
abusive comments posted to the YouTube that are written in Malayalam, which is one of the 
agglutinative languages spoken in the state of Kerala. For this, we use datasets of abusive comments 
in Malayalam and code-mixed Malayalam-English languages that are extracted from YouTube videos. 
Different machine learning approaches with pre-trained language models will be used to implement 
the classifier. Overall, this project may help in detection of abusive comments in Malayalam and may 
help in creation of comment-filters for Malayalam language on YouTube.
